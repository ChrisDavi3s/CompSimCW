* Q1.py - python code to run and plot harmonic oscialltor energy errors
* Q2partA/partB - simulation runs to validate the acceptance criterion for the Monte Carlo question
* Q2PDF - find the PDF for the partB generating distribution to better visualise what is going on
* Q5_CPP_WRAPPER.py -- the entry point for the ising simulation library. LOOK HERE
* ising_simulation.cpp -- shared library of above file written in c++  
* ising_simulation_arm64.so -- compiled version of ising_simulation.cpp.  Compiled to ARM64 so recompilation needed for intel/amd.
